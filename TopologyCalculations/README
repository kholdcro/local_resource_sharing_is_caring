generate_save_graphs.py creates the topologies

The topologies are saved into .pkl into the following folders:
CirclePickles LinePickles TripodPickles DogPickles WheelPickles Pickles1 Pickles2 Pickles3
Create the folders in the same directory


plot_load_different_probs.py generates the probabilities from the graphs

Both need to be modified internally to generate the different topologies.
